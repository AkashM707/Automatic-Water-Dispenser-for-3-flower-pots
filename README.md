# Description of the project #

This arduino project allows you to water your three flower pots thanks to an arduino, a 4 phase stepper motor, a pump and a soil humidity sensor set on a belt pulley system.
The sensor measures the soil humidity of the first pot and when the value is below the threeshold, the motor will start to rotate in order to move the pump and water the three pots.

You can easily extend this code to water more flower pots or to change the distance between the two pots in the code or to change the threeshold of the humidity soil in order to adapt this project to your situation.
